Hello everyone!

We are glad to announce Elixir v1.0.0 is finally out. It has been 8005 commits [by 189 contributors](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/graphs/contributors), including the initial commit in [January 9th, 2011](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/337c3f2d569a42ebd5fcab6fef18c5e012f9be5b)!

## What's Elixir?

Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications.

Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant systems, while also being successfully used in web development and the embedded software domain.

Want to know more? [Check out our home page](http://elixir-lang.org/)!

## What's new?

This release is the consolidation of all the work done throughout the years. With v1.0.0, Elixir is composed of 6 applications:

  * [Elixir](/docs/stable/elixir) - the Elixir compiler, runtime and the standard library
  * [EEx](/docs/stable/eex) - Elixir's templating library, useful for generating any kind of document dynamically
  * [ExUnit](/docs/stable/ex_unit) - Elixir's unit test library, with support for concurrent testing, custom formatters, filters and much more
  * [IEx](/docs/stable/iex) - Elixir's interactive shell with code reloading, auto-complete, and easy access to documentation, typespecs and more
  * [Logger](/docs/stable/logger) - the latest addition to the group, Logger provides reliable logging and configurable backends (with syslog, file and many other backends provided by the community)
  * [Mix](/docs/stable/mix) - Elixir's build tool that generates, compiles and test projects as well as manages your dependencies

Elixir developers also have access to the whole Erlang ecosystem as well as all packages published to the [Hex package manager](http://hex.pm).
